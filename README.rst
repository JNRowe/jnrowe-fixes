fixes-overlay
=============

Packages with fixes submitted to the `Gentoo BTS`_ that have yet to be
applied.  Its main purpose is my staging ground, so I can separately
manage upstreamed fixes.

If you find any problems with ebuilds in this overlay either drop me an
email_ or file an issue_.  Locally, bugs are managed with `Bugs
Everywhere`_, so if you're working with a clone of the repository you
can report, list and fix bugs using ``dev-util/be`` from jnrowe-misc_.
