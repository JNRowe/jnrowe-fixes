jnrowe-fixes Gentoo repository
==============================

.. warning::
   This repository is unmaintained as - like many others - I've completely lost
   interest in submitting fixes to Gentoo.  If you're inside the EADS firewall
   you'll find fixes against upstream's tree in the shared ``gentoo-fixes``
   repository.

Packages with fixes submitted to the `Gentoo BTS`_ that have yet to be applied.
Its main purpose is my staging ground, so I can separately manage upstreamed
fixes.

If you find any problems with ebuilds in this overlay either file an issue_ or
drop me an email_.

.. warning::

   This repository uses thin manifests, which requires a moderately recent
   version of ``portage`` to function correctly(2.1.10.18 or newer).  Using
   older versions is not supported!

This documentation reflects the overlay state as of |today|.
